    This is a sample program which uses joystick buttons to control a relay.
    A Relay (generally a spike) has two outputs, each of which can be at either
    0V or 12V and so can be used for actions such as turning a motor off, full
    forwards, or full reverse, and is generally used on the compressor. This
    program uses two buttons on a joystick and each button corresponds to one
    output; pressing the button sets the output to 12V and releasing sets it to 0V.
